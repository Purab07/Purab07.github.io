  <h1>Purab Kothari</h1>

  
  <h3>My name is Purab Kothari. I am 14 years old and I’m a sophomore in high school. My hobbies are cars, and racing. Since I’m only 14, the closest I can get to driving a car is go karting, so I make sure to do that a lot. Other than that, my other hobbies also include playing guitar, and coding games and projects using Javascript. However, I also part-time volunteer at the Oregon Badminton Academy, and also teach some of the students there.
