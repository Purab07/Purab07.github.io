            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Purab Kothari. I am 16 years old and a junior in high school. My hobbies are cars and racing. Other than that, my other hobbies also include
                playing guitar, and coding games and projects using Javascript. However, I also volunteer at the Oregon Badminton Academy every Wednesday and teach
                the students there.

                I have always been interested in cars, but being 16, I have a minimal range of what I can do. The only racing practice I can do outside of karting is
                on the racing simulator I use to play Assetto Corsa Competizione and F1 23. Some other projects I do relate to cars are creating a V8 
                engine model, searching for used and beaten cars that can hopefully be turned into a project car, and possibly a restoration project. In the meantime, I have been 
                job shadowing at a garage near me and going there for a few months. In my spare time, I have written articles about certain topics in the automotive 
                world and Formula 1. These are 2 topics that I have a great interest in, and I am very passionate about what I write. I write about
                current automotive events, classic Formula 1 moments, and even some argumentative pieces on some F1 topics, all on 
                <a href = "https://purabkblog.blogspot.com/">Blogspot</a> and <a href = "https://medium.com/@purabkothari07">Medium</a>.
