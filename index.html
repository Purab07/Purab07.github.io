            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Purab Kothari. I am 16 years old and a junior in high school. My hobbies are cars and racing. Other than that, my other hobbies also include
                playing guitar, and coding games and projects using Javascript. However, I also volunteer at the Oregon Badminton Academy every Wednesday and teach
                the students there.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always been interested in cars, but being 16, I have a minimal range of what I can do. The only racing practice I can do outside of karting is
                on the racing simulator I use to play Assetto Corsa Competizione and F1 23. Some other projects I do relate to cars are creating a V8 
                engine model, searching for used and beaten cars that can hopefully be turned into a project car, and possibly a restoration project. In the meantime, I have been 
                job shadowing at a garage near me and going there for a few months. In my spare time, I have written articles about certain topics in the automotive 
                world and Formula 1. These are 2 topics that I have a great interest in, and I am very passionate about what I write. I write about
                current automotive events, classic Formula 1 moments, and even some argumentative pieces on some F1 topics, all on

            <h2>10/07/2023</h2>
            <p>
              On my very first day, the customer brought in an early 2000's Toyota Sienna that had some brake issues. By the time I got there, the car was already on a lift, and the wheels were off, so I had a clear view of the braking system at eye level. My boss taught me how to take apart the brake, replace the needed part, and put the new brake system on the car. After he gave me a demo, he left me to do it myself. The problem with the car was that it had drum brakes, which are much harder to work on compared to regular disc brakes as it's a lot more complicated system. The hardest part was removing and putting on the springs, for which I had to use special pliers to grab onto the spring and remove them. Once the brakes were replaced, I helped put the wheels on and lowered the car. While my job was done, the car also had a thermostat that needed replacing, and since that was a bit too complicated, I just watched from the side.
            </p>
            
            <h2>10/14/2023</h2>
            <p>
              On my second day, I learned how to debug issues in cars. The car was an early-2000s Dodge Grand Caravan, where there were some problems with the brake lights and indicators. The first thing we did was find out what problems the car had. It turned out both brake lights and indicators were busted, while the brake light on the top was functional. Next thing was to find out what part of the brake light was broken. Was it the bulb, the fuse, or something else? As it turned out, it was the bulb that was busted. We replaced them, took it for a test drive to see if there were any other problems, topped off the fluids like oil, coolant, and washer fluid, and that was it for my second day.
            </p>
            
            <h2>12/09/2023</h2>
            <p>
              After almost 2 months, I went back to the garage to get back to work. The owner had some personal issues that stopped him from working for a while. On my first day back, I worked on a late 2000's Toyota Camry that needed a thermostat and timing belt replaced. It didn't take too long, but it was difficult to get the timing belt fixed back onto the alternator. The rest of it was trying to find a thermostat that would fit in the pipe.
            </p>
            
            <h2>12/16/2023</h2>
            <p>
              This time, it was a short visit because the owner was feeling sick. However, before he left, we worked on a 2016 Toyota Camry with a transmission issue, where the car would have no power when shifting. This problem was isolated to the broken Neutral Safety Switch, and we couldn't do anything until a replacement arrived. Since there were no other cars there at the moment, he left early, and so did I.
            </p>
            
            <h2>12/30/2023</h2>
            <p>
              After 2 weeks, I returned to the garage, this time starting a project that I was looking forward to for a while: working on a hybrid car's battery, specifically a 2010 Toyota Prius battery. It contained 28 battery cells, and I had to learn how to remove the battery and replace it, which was a challenging yet rewarding experience.
            </p>
            
            <h2>01/06/2024</h2>
            <p>
              After fixing the battery last time, the Prius had an issue with the steering wheel, which had started making a weird noise while turning. I was tasked with figuring out the source of the noise and correcting it. I discovered it was a problem with the power steering fluid level and some worn-out components that needed replacement. It was great to apply what I had learned about car systems to troubleshoot the issue effectively.
            </p>
            
            <h2>01/28/2024</h2>
            <p>
              I hadn't been to the shop in a while because of the massive winter storm that hit our area. When I returned, there were several cars waiting to be serviced. I started with a 2007 Honda Civic that needed a new battery and brake pads. It felt good to jump back into the routine and tackle the tasks at hand, and I enjoyed working on the Civic, as it was a straightforward job that allowed me to work efficiently.
            </p>
            
            <h2>02/03/2024</h2>
            <p>
              Today when I went there, I had 2 cars to work on. The first was a 2015 Ford Focus that had a flat tire, and the second was an older Chevy Malibu with an overheating issue. I changed the tire on the Focus quickly, and then I focused on the Malibu. I had to check the coolant levels and look for leaks. After running some tests, I found that the thermostat was stuck closed, causing the overheating. I replaced the thermostat, and the car was good to go.
            </p>
            
            <h2>02/10/2024</h2>
            <p>
              I went there a bit earlier than usual this time. The owner had a busy day lined up, and he wanted me to help out as much as possible. I started working on a 2014 Nissan Altima that had an issue with the air conditioning. I learned how to diagnose AC problems and eventually found that the compressor was faulty. It was a bit more challenging than I expected, but I felt proud to have contributed to fixing it.
            </p>
            
            <h2>02/24/2024</h2>
            <p>
              Today, I went there a little late, and when I did, there wasn't much work to do. The owner had finished up with the cars for the day. We had a bit of a chat about the different types of vehicles he had worked on over the years, and it was interesting to hear his stories. Even though I didnâ€™t work on any cars, I learned a lot just from listening to him.
            </p>
            
            <h2>03/17/2024</h2>
            <p>
              After almost a month of not visiting the garage due to multiple problems, this visit was one of the busiest days I had experienced. There were several cars lined up for service, and I jumped right in to help out with oil changes, brake replacements, and various other tasks. It felt great to be back in action and work alongside the owner to tackle the backlog of work.
            </p>
            
            <h2>03/23/2024</h2>
            <p>
              I went to the garage this time with a Subaru Forester on the car lift. It needed a full inspection due to some strange noises coming from the engine. I had the opportunity to learn about the different components under the hood and how to properly diagnose issues. It was a valuable learning experience, and I felt like I was really starting to understand more about automotive mechanics.
            </p>
            
            <h2>06/30/2024</h2>
            <p>
              After not going to the garage for a few months, I had a big project on the first day back. The owner had a classic 1970s Chevy truck that needed a complete restoration. I was excited to get my hands dirty and work on something so unique. We started by assessing the truckâ€™s condition and making a list of parts that needed replacement. It was a challenging but thrilling project that I couldnâ€™t wait to dive into.
            </p>
            
            <h2>07/17/2024</h2>
            <p>
              This time, I was working a lot more independently. The owner trusted me to handle some of the simpler projects on my own, like oil changes and minor repairs. It felt good to have that level of responsibility, and I appreciated the confidence he had in my skills. I managed to complete all my tasks efficiently, which made me feel like I was making real progress in my apprenticeship.
