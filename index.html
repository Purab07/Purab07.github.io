            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Purab Kothari. I am 16 years old and a junior in high school. My hobbies are cars and racing. Other than that, my other hobbies also include
                playing guitar, and coding games and projects using Javascript. However, I also volunteer at the Oregon Badminton Academy every Wednesday and teach
                the students there.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always been interested in cars, but being 16, I have a minimal range of what I can do. The only racing practice I can do outside of karting is
                on the racing simulator I use to play Assetto Corsa Competizione and F1 23. Some other projects I do relate to cars are creating a V8 
                engine model, searching for used and beaten cars that can hopefully be turned into a project car, and possibly a restoration project. In the meantime, I have been 
                job shadowing at a garage near me and going there for a few months. In my spare time, I have written articles about certain topics in the automotive 
                world and Formula 1. These are 2 topics that I have a great interest in, and I am very passionate about what I write. I write about
                current automotive events, classic Formula 1 moments, and even some argumentative pieces on some F1 topics, all on

            <h2>10/07/2023</h2>
    <p>On my very first day, the customer brought in an early 2000's Toyota Sienna that had some brake issues. By the time I got there, the car was already on a lift, and the wheels were off, so I had a clear view of the braking system at eye level. My boss taught me how to take apart the brake, replace the needed part, and put the new brake system on the car. After he gave me a demo, he left me to do it myself. The problem with the car was that it had drum brakes, which are much harder to work on compared to regular disc brakes as it's a lot more complicated system. The hardest part was removing and putting on the springs, for which I had to use a special type of plier to grab onto the spring and remove them. Once the brakes were replaced, I helped put the wheels on, and lowered the car. While my job was done, the car also had a thermostat that needed replacing, and since that was a bit too complicated, I just watched from the side.</p>
    
    <h2>10/14/2023</h2>
    <p>On my second day, I learned how to debug issues in cars. The car was an early-2000s Dodge Grand Caravan, where there were some problems with the brake lights and indicators. The first thing we did was find out what problems the car had. It turned out both brake lights and indicators were busted, while the brake light on the top was functional. Next thing was to find out what part of the brake light was broken. Was it the bulb, the fuse, or if it was something else? As it turned out, it was the bulb that was busted. We replaced them, took it for a test drive to see if there were any other problems, then just topped off the fluids like oil, coolant, and washer fluid, and that was it for my second day.</p>
    
    <h2>12/09/2023</h2>
    <p>After almost 2 months, I went back to the garage to get back to work. The owner had some personal issues which stopped him from working for a while. On my first day back, I worked on a late 2000's Toyota Camry that needed a thermostat and timing belt replaced. It did not take too long, but it was difficult to get the timing belt fixed back onto the alternator. The rest of it was trying to find a thermostat that would fit in the pipe.</p>
    
    <h2>12/16/2023</h2>
    <p>This time, it was a short visit because the owner was feeling sick. However, before he left, me and him worked on a 2016 Toyota Camry with a transmission issue, where the car would have no power when shifting. This problem was isolated to the broken Neutral Safety Switch, and we could not do anything until a replacement arrived. However, since there were no other cars there at the moment, he left early, and so did I.</p>
    
    <h2>12/30/2023</h2>
    <p>After 2 weeks, I returned back to his garage, this time starting a project that I was looking forward to for a while, which was working on a hybrid car's battery, specifically a 2010 Toyota Prius battery. It contained 28 battery cells, out of which a few of them were broken. I had to test all 28 cells to find out which ones were broken and had to replace them. The complicated part, however, were the many bolts and screws I had to take out. The plates had a lot of corrosion, which was a reason why there was a loss of charge. I had to fix 56 plates, and once those were done, I had to work around the temperature sensor and the various other cables and parts. The whole thing took me 6 hours to do, and the next time I visit there, I will complete the second part, which is to install it into the car.</p>

    <h2>01/06/2024</h2>
    <p>After fixing the battery last time, the Prius had an issue with the steering wheel that required a part replacement. Immediately, I had to go to work disassembling the steering wheel. However, in order to prevent the airbag from blowing up in my face, I had to disconnect the battery to cut the power to the airbag. After that, it was not a very complicated procedure, however it was difficult to work around all the cables there, and to reconnect the correct cable to the correct slot. Another big issue with the Prius was the poor build quality, making it hard to reattach the steering wheel cover once I was done.</p>

    <h2>01/28/2024</h2>
    <p>I hadn't been to the shop in a while because of the massive winter storm in my area, but when I did, there was still a lot to do. The first thing I did when I went there was diagnose a problem in a customer's Honda CRV. As it turned out, the car wasn't feeding oil into the engine properly, meaning there was a problem with the V-TEC solenoid. This should've been a simple enough replacement of a piece, but the problem was that the solenoid was in a highly inaccessible area behind the engine block, meaning I had to remove it practically blindfolded. However, that was done pretty quick, and the car was finished. The owner of the shop had a replica of a 1930 Mercedes powered by a 2.0 liter Ford engine. It was a sensational looking car, and I drove it around the block. The throttle was very weird to use because it was more like a button on the floor of the car rather than a traditional pedal, and the brake was barely slowing the car down. There was also no power steering in the car, so parallel parking the car back in its spot was a nightmare, but it was the most fun I have ever had driving a car anywhere. I parked it inside the garage because it had some problems with the taillights when braking, but all I needed to do was replace the bulb, so it was a simple fix.</p>

    <h2>02/03/2024</h2>
    <p>Today when I went there, I had 2 cars to work on. The first one was a 2007 Mercedes AMG ML63 that had an issue in the steering wheel buttons. All I had to do was replace the steering wheel, something I had done before. However, there was an issue the moment I started working on it. Behind the steering wheel, there are 2 screws in every car that removes the steering wheel. I got one screw removed, but the other one was not coming out. The wrench was spinning, but the screw would not come out, even after trying to remove it for 2 minutes. The owner of the shop came and tried to remove it, but even he couldn't get it out, so he had to call his friend, who had some tools he could work with. Since I couldn't do anything about it, I started working on the other car, which was the old Mercedes replica I was working with last time. The car was almost finished, but to make sure there were no leaks of any kind, I took it for a test drive, and when I came back, the only thing I noticed was a faint smell, but no leaks. It was a pretty short day, but it was good to see that the car was fully functional again.</p>

    <h2>02/10/2024</h2>
    <p>I went there a bit earlier than usual this time, and so I had more time to do things. I started off with diagnosing the problem in a 2004 Toyota Sienna minivan with an OBD 2 scanner. The problem, as it turned out, was a broken gearbox which needed some fixing. I handed the car over to another person at the garage, and started on the main focus of the day, which was to replace the steering column on a 2007 Mercedes Benz ML450. To remove the steering wheel first, there were 2 screws on either side of the wheel. I got one screw out easily, but the other side was broken. I used a mirror and a flashlight to inspect the damage, but because of the way the screw was positioned behind the wheel, and the tiny hole that the screw was in, it was very hard to see the screw itself. So I switched to a tiny camera attached to a handheld monitor that would show me live what the camera was seeing. So I sent the camera into the hole. As it turned out, the screw was damaged to the point where we would need a magnet to remove it. However, our magnet was too big to fit in the hole, so I used a drill to widen the hole the screw was in. Once I was done drilling the hole, however, it turned out that the plastic material that was being drilled out was only getting pushed in, which effectively made a wall around the screw. I spent 3 hours trying to pick out the plastic from the hole with a pick, but in the end, I had to give up, and the owner of the garage had to go and get a special tool to help remove the screw and remove the plastic covering it.</p>

    <h2>02/18/2024</h2>
    <p>When I went this time, it was a mostly simple day. I started off by fixing a Honda CRV. The car had trouble starting, so I had to diagnose the problem using an OBD II scanner. The issue was that the alternator wasn’t charging the battery properly, so I replaced it. The alternator was in a difficult-to-reach place, so removing it took a lot of effort, but the replacement itself wasn’t too bad.</p>

    <h2>06/08/2024</h2>
    <p>A 2005 BMW X5 was the focus today. The car came in with a check engine light, and the OBD scanner revealed it had a misfire in cylinder 3. After swapping the ignition coil with another cylinder, we confirmed the coil was bad. I replaced the coil and the spark plug, and the engine ran smoothly afterward.</p>

    <h2>06/22/2024</h2>
    <p>Today was a bit of a throwback. I worked on a 2000 Honda Accord that had a rusted fuel line, causing a leak. This was a bit of a challenge because the line was corroded in multiple places. I had to cut out the bad sections and replace them with new lines, which took a lot of patience and precision. In the end, the fuel system was sealed up properly, and there were no more leaks.</p>

    <h2>07/06/2024</h2>
    <p>Today, a 2015 Volkswagen Jetta came into the shop with issues related to the air conditioning system. The AC wasn’t blowing cold air. After checking the refrigerant level, we found it was low, and there was a leak in one of the lines. We replaced the line, recharged the system with refrigerant, and the AC was working perfectly again.</p>

    <h2>07/17/2024</h2>
    <p>This was a really exciting day because I got to work on a 2021 Tesla Model 3. The car had a tire puncture, and while fixing that was straightforward, the owner also asked us to check the suspension and the battery health. I got to learn how to use Tesla’s diagnostic tools, and everything checked out fine. It was interesting to work on an electric car, which is very different from the typical internal combustion engine vehicles I’ve been used to.</p>
