  <h1>Purab Kothari</h1>

  
  <h3>My name is Purab Kothari. I am 15 years old and a sophomore in high school. My hobbies are cars, racing and Chess. Other than that, my other hobbies also include
    playing guitar, and coding games and projects using Javascript. However, I also volunteer at the Oregon Badminton Academy every Wednesday, and also teach some of 
    the students there.
   </h3>
   <br>
    <h3>
    I have always been interested in cars, but me being 15, I have a very limited range on what I can do. The only racing practice that I can do outside of karting is
    on my racing simulator that I use to play Assetto Corsa Competenzione and F1 2021. Even then, my schedule is always packed with homework because of school, along 
    with extra Spanish classes I'm taking, which keep me busy till 12 at night sometimes. I barely have time to do things outside of homework, and when I finally do 
    finish it, I have other things to do, like household chores, helping my little brother with his homework, and finishing other projects that I have, like a V8 
    engine model that I'm building. Hopefully, next year when I complete my Spanish class, I can finally get time to work on things I enjoy most, which is on cars.
