            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Purab Kothari. I am 17 years old and a senior in high school. My hobbies are cars and racing. Other hobbies include
                playing guitar, coding games, and creating Javascript projects. However, I also volunteer at the Oregon Badminton Academy every Friday and teach
                the students there.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always been interested in cars, but being 17, I have a minimal range of what I can do. The only racing practice I can do outside of karting is
                on the racing simulator I use to play Assetto Corsa Competizione and F1 23. Some other projects I do relate to cars are creating a V8 
                engine model, and even got a project car to work on. It's a Scion FR-S in great condition. The only issue was that the previous revved the car too much,
                leading the car's crankshaft bearing to wear out. It took a few hours to disassemble the boxer engine, all for a $20 part.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the meantime, I have been 
                job shadowing at a garage near me and going there for a few months. I have written articles about specific topics in the automotive
                world and Formula 1 in my spare time. These are two topics that I have a great interest in, and I am very passionate about what I write. I write about
                current automotive events, classic Formula 1 moments, and even some argumentative pieces on some F1 topics, all on 
                <a href = "https://purabkblog.blogspot.com/">Blogspot</a> and <a href = "https://medium.com/@purabkothari07">Medium</a>.

            <h2>10/07/2023</h2>
            <p>On my very first day, the customer brought in an early 2000's Toyota Sienna that had some brake issues. By the time I got there, the car was already on a lift, and the wheels were off, so I had a clear view of the braking system at eye level. My boss taught me how to take apart the brake, replace the needed part, and put the new brake system on the car. After he gave me a demo, he left me to do it myself. The problem with the car was that it had drum brakes, which are much harder to work on compared to regular disc brakes as it's a lot more complicated system. The hardest part was removing and putting on the springs, for which I had to use a special type of plier to grab onto the spring and remove them. Once the brakes were replaced, I helped put the wheels on, and lowered the car. While my job was done, the car also had a thermostat that needed replacing, and since that was a bit too complicated, I just watched from the side.</p>

            <h2>10/14/2023</h2>
            <p>On my second day, I learned how to debug issues in cars. The car was an early-2000s Dodge Grand Caravan, where there were some problems with the brake lights and indicators. The first thing we did was find out what problems the car had. It turned out both brake lights and indicators were busted, while the brake light on the top was functional. Next thing was to find out what part of the brake light was broken. Was it the bulb, the fuse, or if it was something else? As it turned out, it was the bulb that was busted. We replaced them, took it for a test drive to see if there were any other problems, then just topped off the fluids like oil, coolant, and washer fluid, and that was it for my second day.</p>
