  <h3>For my CAD 1 class, one of our projects was to make an original design, and then turn that into a sticker. This was the final design I came up with, based off of a 1937 Bugatti Type 57 Atlantic.</h3>

  <h3>I cut it out on a a blue vinyl, same color as Bugatti's original racing color. Once it was cut out, I transfered it onto a black altoid tin, and this was the final product:</h3>

  <h3>The next thing I had to make was a racecar that I would race on a hot wheels track. I wanted to model it off of a McLaren Speedtail, since that car's body shape was very aerodynamic-focused. However, during 
    the design, it was much harder to replicate the body of the McLaren, so I took my own ideas, such as adding popup headlights and a different rear end. We had to 3D print the body of the car, then add the axles afterwards
    with toothpicks and tiny wooden wheels. All put together, it looked like this:

  <h3>Right after that one, my next project was to make a duplicate item. That meant I would take anything I could find and make a 1:1 replica of it. I chose a chess pawn, and to do it, I took measurements of every 
  aspect of the piece, and put it in the designing software. After printing it, I put them next to each other, and they looked identical.</h3>

    In my Robotics class, the first proper project was a robot that could steer itself. My original plan was to have a 4 wheel drive car with a steering column that would rotate with a small motor attached between the wheels 
    and under the LEGO EV3 brain. However, it was super hard to incorporate the small motor into the frame of the car, but after a while, I was able to attach it in there, and the robot was fully functional. For the fun of it,
    I experimented with a 6 speed gearbox attached to the end, which was super difficult to make and attach, but I got it to mount on the rear end of the car.
