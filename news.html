    While I do volunteer at Oregon Badminton Academy, I have also started volunteering at a garage every Saturday for up to 6 hours. This is what I've done each day there:

    On my very first day, the customer brought in a early 2000's Toyota Sienna that had some brake issues. By the time I got there, the car was already on a lift, and the wheels were off, so I had a clear view of the 
    braking system at eye-level. My boss taught me how to take apart the brake, replace the needed part, and put the new brake system on the car. After he gave me a demo, he left me to do it myself. The problem with the 
    car was that it had drum brakes, which are much harder to work on compared to regular disc brakes as it's a lot more complicated system. The hardest part was removing and putting on the springs, for which I had to use 
    a special type of plier to grab onto the spring and remove them. Once the brakes were replaced, I helped put the wheels on, and lowered the car. While my job was done, the car also had a thermostat that needed replacing,
    and since that was a bit too complicated, I just watched from the side.

  On my second day, I learned how to debug issues in cars. The car was an early-2000s Dodge Grand Caravan, where there were some problems with the brake lights and indicators. The first thing we did was find out what
  problems the car had. It turned out both brake lights and indicators were busted, while the brake light on the top was functional. Nex thing was to find out what part of the brake light was broken. Was it the bulb, 
  the fuse, or if it was something else. As it turned out, it was the bulb that was busted. We replaced them, took it for a test drive to see if there were any other problems, then just topped off the fluids like 
  oil, coolant, and washer fluid, and that was it for my second day.

    After almost 2 months, I went back to the garage to get back to work. The owner had some personal issues which stopped him from working for a while. On my first day back, I worked on a late 2000's Toyota Camry that 
    needed a thermostat and timing belt replaced. It did not take too long, but it was difficult to get the timing belt fixed back onto the alternator. The rest of it was trying to find a thermostat that would fit in the 
    pipe.

     This time, it was a short visit because the owner was feeling sick. However, before he left, me and him worked on a 2016 Toyota Camry
    with a transmission issue, where the car would have no power when shifting. This problem was isolated to the broken Neutral Safety Switch,
    and we could not do anything until a replacement arrived. However, since there were no other cars there at the moment, he left early, 
    and so did I.

     After 2 weeks, I returned back to his garage, this time starting a project that I was looking forward to for a while, which was working on a hybrid car's battery, specifically a 2010 Toyota Prius battery.
    It contained 28 battery cells, out of which a few of them were broken. I had to test all 28 cells to find out which ones were broken, and had to replace them. The complicated part, however, were the many bolts and 
    screws I had to take out. The plates had a lot of corrosion, which was a reason why there was a loss of charge. I had to fix 56 plates, and once those were done, I had to work around the temperature sensor and the 
    various other cables and parts. The whole thing took me 6 hours to do, and the next time I visit there, I will complete the second part, which is to install it into the car.

     After fixing the battery last time, the Prius had an issue with the steering wheel that required a part replacement. Immediately, I had to go to work dissasembling the steering wheel. However, in order to prevent the 
    airbag from blowing up in my face, I had to disconnect the battery to cut the power to the airbag. After that, it was not a very complicated procedure, however it was 
    difficult to work around all the cables there, and to reconnect the correct cable to the correct slot. Another big issue with the Prius was the poor build quality, making it hard to reattach the steering wheel cover
    once I was done.

     I hadn't been to the shop in a while because of the massive winter storm in my area, but when I did, there was still a lot to do. The first thing I did when I went there was diagnose a problem in a customer's Honda CRV. 
    As it turned out, the car wasn't feeding oil into the engine properly, meaning there was a problem with the V-TEC solenoid. This should've been a simple enough replacement of a piece, but the problem was that the solenoid 
    was in a highly inaccessible area behind the engine block, meaning I had to remove it practically blindfolded. However, that was done pretty quick, and the car was finished. The owner of the shop had a replica of a 1930 
    Mercedes powered by a 2.0 liter Ford engine. It was a sensational looking car, and I drove it around the block. The throttle was very weird to use because it was more like a button on the floor of the car rather than a 
    traditional pedal, and the brake was barely slowing the car down. There was also no power steering in the car, so parallel parking the car back in its spot was a nightmare, but it was the most fun I have ever had driving 
    a car anywhere. I parked it inside the garage because it had some problems with the taillights when braking, but all I needed to do was replace the bulb, so it was a simple fix.
