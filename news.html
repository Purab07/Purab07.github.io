    While I do volunteer at Oregon Badminton Academy, I have also started volunteering at a garage every Saturday for up to 6 hours. This is what I've done each day there:

    On my very first day, the customer brought in a early 2000's Toyota Sienna that had some brake issues. By the time I got there, the car was already on a lift, and the wheels were off, so I had a clear view of the 
    braking system at eye-level. My boss taught me how to take apart the brake, replace the needed part, and put the new brake system on the car. After he gave me a demo, he left me to do it myself. The problem with the 
    car was that it had drum brakes, which are much harder to work on compared to regular disc brakes as it's a lot more complicated system. The hardest part was removing and putting on the springs, for which I had to use 
    a special type of plier to grab onto the spring and remove them. Once the brakes were replaced, I helped put the wheels on, and lowered the car. While my job was done, the car also had a thermostat that needed replacing,
    and since that was a bit too complicated, I just watched from the side.

  On my second day, I learned how to debug issues in cars. The car was an early-2000s Dodge Grand Caravan, where there were some problems with the brake lights and indicators. The first thing we did was find out what
  problems the car had. It turned out both brake lights and indicators were busted, while the brake light on the top was functional. Nex thing was to find out what part of the brake light was broken. Was it the bulb, 
  the fuse, or if it was something else. As it turned out, it was the bulb that was busted. We replaced them, took it for a test drive to see if there were any other problems, then just topped off the fluids like 
  oil, coolant, and washer fluid, and that was it for my second day.

    After almost 2 months, I went back to the garage to get back to work. The owner had some personal issues which stopped him from working for a while. On my first day back, I worked on a late 2000's Toyota Camry that 
    needed a thermostat and timing belt replaced. It did not take too long, but it was difficult to get the timing belt fixed back onto the alternator. The rest of it was trying to find a thermostat that would fit in the 
    pipe.

     This time, it was a short visit because the owner was feeling sick. However, before he left, me and him worked on a 2016 Toyota Camry
    with a transmission issue, where the car would have no power when shifting. This problem was isolated to the broken Neutral Safety Switch,
    and we could not do anything until a replacement arrived. However, since there were no other cars there at the moment, he left early, 
    and so did I.

     After 2 weeks, I returned back to his garage, this time starting a project that I was looking forward to for a while, which was working on a hybrid car's battery, specifically a 2010 Toyota Prius battery.
    It contained 28 battery cells, out of which a few of them were broken. I had to test all 28 cells to find out which ones were broken, and had to replace them. The complicated part, however, were the many bolts and 
    screws I had to take out. The plates had a lot of corrosion, which was a reason why there was a loss of charge. I had to fix 56 plates, and once those were done, I had to work around the temperature sensor and the 
    various other cables and parts. The whole thing took me 6 hours to do, and the next time I visit there, I will complete the second part, which is to install it into the car.

     After fixing the battery last time, the Prius had an issue with the steering wheel that required a part replacement. Immediately, I had to go to work dissasembling the steering wheel. However, in order to prevent the 
    airbag from blowing up in my face, I had to disconnect the battery to cut the power to the airbag. After that, it was not a very complicated procedure, however it was 
    difficult to work around all the cables there, and to reconnect the correct cable to the correct slot. Another big issue with the Prius was the poor build quality, making it hard to reattach the steering wheel cover
    once I was done.

     I hadn't been to the shop in a while because of the massive winter storm in my area, but when I did, there was still a lot to do. The first thing I did when I went there was diagnose a problem in a customer's Honda CRV. 
    As it turned out, the car wasn't feeding oil into the engine properly, meaning there was a problem with the V-TEC solenoid. This should've been a simple enough replacement of a piece, but the problem was that the solenoid 
    was in a highly inaccessible area behind the engine block, meaning I had to remove it practically blindfolded. However, that was done pretty quick, and the car was finished. The owner of the shop had a replica of a 1930 
    Mercedes powered by a 2.0 liter Ford engine. It was a sensational looking car, and I drove it around the block. The throttle was very weird to use because it was more like a button on the floor of the car rather than a 
    traditional pedal, and the brake was barely slowing the car down. There was also no power steering in the car, so parallel parking the car back in its spot was a nightmare, but it was the most fun I have ever had driving 
    a car anywhere. I parked it inside the garage because it had some problems with the taillights when braking, but all I needed to do was replace the bulb, so it was a simple fix.

     Today when I went there, I had 2 cars to work on. The first one was a 2007 Mercedes AMG ML63 that had an issue in the steering wheel buttons. All I had to do was replace the steering wheel, something I had done before. However,
    there was an issue the moment I started working on it. Behind the steering wheel, there are 2 screws in every car that removes the steering wheel. I got one screw removed, but the other one was not coming out. The wrench was spinning,
    but the screw would not come out, even after trying to remove it for 2 minutes. The owner of the shop came and tried to remove it, but even he couldn't get it out, so he had to call his friend, who had some tools he could work with.
    Since I couldn't do anything about it, I started working on the other car, which was the old Mercedes replica I was working with last time. The car was almost finished, but to make sure there were no leaks of any kind, I took it for a test 
    drive, and when I came back, the only thing I noticed was a faint smell, but no leaks. It was a pretty short day, but it was good to see that the car was fully functional again.

     I went there a bit earlier than usual this time, and so I had more time to do things. I started off with diagonsing the problem in a 2004 Toyota Sienna minivan with an OBD 2 scanner. The problem, as it turned out, was a broken gearbox which 
    needed some fixing. I handed the car over to another person at the garage, and started on the main focus of the day, which was to replace the steering column on a 2007 Mercedes Benz ML450. To remove the steering wheel first, there were 2 screws 
    on either side of the wheel. I got one screw out easily, but the other side was broken. I used a mirror and a flashlight to inspect the damage, but because of the way the screw was positioned behind the wheel, and the tiny hole that the screw was 
    in, it was very hard to see the screw itself. So I switched to a tiny camera attached to a handheld monitor that would show me live what the camera was seeing. So I sent the camera into the hole. As it turned out, the screw was damaged to the point 
    where we would need a magnet to remove it. However, our magnet was too big to fit in the hole, so I used a drill to widen the hole the screw was in. 
    Once I was done drilling the hole, however, it turned out that the plastic material that was being drilled out was only getting pushed in, which effectively made a wall around the screw. I spent 3 hours trying to pick out the plastic from the hole
    with a pick, but in the end, I had to give up, and the owner of the garage had to go and get a special tool to help remove the screw and remove the plastic covering it.

     When I went this time, it was a mostly simple day. I started off by fixing a Honda CRV. The car had trouble starting, so whenever the key was turned over, it would try to spark, but it wouldn;t do it enough. The problem, as it turned out, was that 
    the battery terminal had corrosion all over it, preventing electricity from reaching the starter. It had a simple solution, which was to pour a small amount of Coke on the corrosion and chip away at the corrosion. After that, all that was left was to 
    reattach the terminal, and the car was running smoothly again. After that, I started working on a Toyota Prius with a broken power window. The inside mechanism had a small motor that was broken, so we had to replace the entire mechanism. However, while 
    removing the mechanism, the entire mechanism collapsed within the door, which made it very hard to work with. After half an hour, I was able to get the mechanism out and put the new one in. However, after painfully fitting the new one in the door, I 
    realized the new mechanism had the incorrect screw holes. So I had to remove the mechanism again and modify it to work with the proper screws. After finally fittig the new and modified mechanism, the power windows were working again.

     Today, I went there a little late, and when I did, there was not a lot of work to do. There was a customer who walked in with a 2017 Lexus RX350 with a Tire Pressure Monitor System warning light. At first, I used a scanner and put it against all 4 air 
    valves because that's where the sensors were placed. I expected 1, maybe 2 sensors to be malfunctioning. However, all 4 sensors failed, so I believed there must be an issue with the scanner. I messed around with the scanner settings for a while before 
    trying all 4 scanners again, but again it resulted in all 4 failing. I tried the scanner on a car whose scanner I knew was working, the owner of the shop worked with the car settings and figured out a way to reprogram the car's computer so the error would
    go away. After it worked, I did a few more smaller things with some other cars and scanners for a little while until the owner had to leave early, so I left as well.

     After almost a month of not visiting the garage due to multiple problems, this visit was one of the busiest days I had. There was a 1987 Mercedes 300 SDL with a 6 cylinder diesel engine that had problems idling. However, before I started working on this car,
    I replaced the tires on a Toyota Prius from snow tires to summer tires. This was actually the first time I changed tires on a car despite working with cars for years, and it was difficult because the tire was not properly fitting onto the car, but it turned out
    that I needed to properly hammer the wheel in to make sure it settled. Once that was done, I finally started working on the Mercedes. The first thing I had to do was fix the ignition timing. It was difficult to lock the timing in because of the way the took was 
    working since I needed to rotate the tool using a small screw. I had to use a saw to cut the screw slit open a little bit more so that the screwdriver could properly rotate the tool. The next thing I had to do was remove the diesel pump. Normally, I would learn
    how to fix the current part of the car instead of replacing the part, but repairing this one would require a special machine that we didn't have, so I had to settle for just removing the part for now. However, it was easier said than done, since the 4 screws 
    that held the part to the car were in such a difficult position, the tensioner could not properly reach the screws, so I had to find some workarounds to get the part out. The next thing I needed to work on the car was so hard to remove, it was outside my skill 
    level, and required the owner of the garage and his brother to work together to remove the piece. This was the diesel injection system, which was super difficult because there were multiple connections between not only the diesel pipes, but the oil connections 
    as well, leading to multiple spillages. I also spilled a lot of oil on my pants and shoes, which I halfway cleaned off using acid and brake cleaner on them, then wiping it down with a rag. The final thing I did was replace the ignition coil on a customer's Toyota
    Sienna, which was difficult because the engine had just been turned off and I almost burned my fingers off. While all of this was already labor intensive, I had to do all of this in the outdoors on an especially sunny day, which completely wiped me out.

    I went to the garage this time with a Subaru Forester on the car lift with a hood popped up and an engine missing. The engine was on the side, and it needed a head gasket replacement. With almost any other car, the head gasket could be a relatively easy replacement
    as long as the engine was an inline engine or a V shaped engine. However, since Subaru makes boxer engines with the cylinders on the side, the easiest way would be to remove the engine from the car just to replace the head gaskets, which is super inconvenient because 
    a head gasket is the most common thing to fail on a Subaru. However, a head ghasket replacement was a lot more difficult than I thought. Simply tightening the bolts and screws would require the bolts to be screwed in a very specific order on a particular amount of
    torque, and then they would need to be tightened again at another torque. Along with tightening the bolts, I also tuned the valves to make sure they would be functioning properly by making sure they were at the exact perfect height. I would have stayed there until the 
    engine was back in the car, but then I had to catch a flight because I was going to a trip to see some colleges, so I left a little early.

    After not going to the garage for a few months, I had a big project on the first day back. The owner had a 4 cylinder on an engine mount, and he was just finishing fixing the engine block. I spent the next 6 hours outside in the heat putting the engine bit by bit, 
    fitting things like the timing chain, the individual valves, spark plugs and the engine head. I was fried by the end of the day, but I still had a 45-minute drive back home.
