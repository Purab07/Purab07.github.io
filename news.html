    While I do volunteer at Oregon Badminton Academy, I have also started volunteering at a garage every Saturday for up to 6 hours. This is what I've done each day there:

    On my very first day, the customer brought in a early 2000's Toyota Sienna that had some brake issues. By the time I got there, the car was already on a lift, and the wheels were off, so I had a clear view of the 
    braking system at eye-level. My boss taught me how to take apart the brake, replace the needed part, and put the new brake system on the car. After he gave me a demo, he left me to do it myself. The problem with the 
    car was that it had drum brakes, which are much harder to work on compared to regular disc brakes as it's a lot more complicated system. The hardest part was removing and putting on the springs, for which I had to use 
    a special type of plier to grab onto the spring and remove them. Once the brakes were replaced, I helped put the wheels on, and lowered the car. While my job was done, the car also had a thermostat that needed replacing,
    and since that was a bit too complicated, I just watched from the side.

  On my second day, I learned how to debug issues in cars. The car was an early-2000s Dodge Grand Caravan, where there were some problems with the brake lights and indicators. The first thing we did was find out what
  problems the car had. It turned out both brake lights and indicators were busted, while the brake light on the top was functional. Nex thing was to find out what part of the brake light was broken. Was it the bulb, 
  the fuse, or if it was something else. As it turned out, it was the bulb that was busted. We replaced them, took it for a test drive to see if there were any other problems, then just topped off the fluids like 
  oil, coolant, and washer fluid, and that was it for my second day.
